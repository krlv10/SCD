# SCD
Skin Cancer Detector (AI) trained and tested on ~3300 images of malignant and benign tumors
***
This project is a skin cancer detector that uses CNN and deep learning algorithms to classify skin lesions as either malignant or benign. The AI has been trained and tested on a dataset of approximately 3300 images, resulting in an accuracy of about 75%.

The skin cancer detector has practical applications in the medical field, as it can be used by dermatologists to quickly and accurately diagnose skin cancer in patients. By analyzing skin lesions and identifying malignancy, doctors can determine the best course of treatment and provide patients with better outcomes.

The skin cancer detector can also be used by individuals who are concerned about their skin health. By taking a picture of a skin lesion and submitting it to the AI, users can receive a diagnosis and decide if they need to seek medical attention.

One of the advantages of the skin cancer detector is its high accuracy rate, which means that it can help reduce misdiagnosis and unnecessary biopsies. It is also a faster and more efficient method of diagnosis, allowing doctors to provide patients with prompt treatment.

Overall, skin cancer detector has the potential to improve patient outcomes and make the diagnosis of skin cancer more accurate and efficient.
